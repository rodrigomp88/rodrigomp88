# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello, my name is Rodrigo Pinea. I am a UI/UX designer from Argentina, Mendoza. Passionate about new web and mobile technologies, I learned the old methods of functional software development. I use various programming and layout languages, cloud storage services, tools to speed up development, task management systems and I know something about software performance quality testing.
